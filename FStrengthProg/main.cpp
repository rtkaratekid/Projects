     clang++ -std=c++11 -c main.cpp
     This compiles main.cpp into the file main.o (check this with ls to confirm).  The -std=c++11 part lets us use some things that C++ added in 2011.  The -c means "compile"
     now, we're going to link the compiled files together (in this case there's actually only 1), again using clang:
     clang++ -o main main.o
     This will create a file called main which is the executable program.  The "-o main" part means "name the output main" Run your executable program with the following:
     ./main
     the ./ part just means "use the program called main in this folder"
     Try passing commandline arguments to your program with something like:
     ./main these are command line argument
